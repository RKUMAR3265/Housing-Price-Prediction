This project performs **Housing Price Prediction** using regression techniques on a housing dataset.
## Objective
The goal of this task is to build a model that can **predict house prices** based on features like area, number of rooms, location, etc.  
This helps in understanding the factors affecting housing prices and enables data-driven decision making.
## Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical features into numerical using encoding
   - Scaled numerical features
2. **Model Building**
   - Applied **Linear Regression**
   - Applied **Random Forest Regression** (optional)
   - Evaluated models using **RÂ² score** and **RMSE**
3. **Visualization**
   - Plotted actual vs predicted prices
   - Feature importance plots (for Random Forest)
## Dataset
